# Google Chrome Search Tabbing

Since the [removal of Google's "Instant search"](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/26/16034844/google-kills-off-instant-search-for-mobile-consistency), it is no longer possible to tab through the results. This plugin will add back in that functionality.

### Install

The extension can be found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-chrome-search-tabb/fgmnkcffojicmpaohafpiceihcpeleka).

### Demo

### How to use it

The keys to note are `TAB`, `DOWN ARROW` and the `UP ARROW`, this will cycle through all of the result links on the page. Click enter to go to that result.

### Issues

The link selectors for what I consider a "clickable result" are a bit vague due to the markup that Google Search responds with. If you find examples of results that don't allow you to tab to the point you want, please open an [issue](https://github.com/scripter-co/google-chrome-search-tabbing/issues/new) with the results page you're trying.
