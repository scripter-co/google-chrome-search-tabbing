# Google Chrome Search Tabbing

Since the [removal of Google's "Instant search"](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/26/16034844/google-kills-off-instant-search-for-mobile-consistency), it is no longer possible to tab through the results. This plugin will add back in that functionality.

### Demo

### How to use it

The keys to note are `TAB`, `DOWN ARROW` and the `UP ARROW`, this will cycle through all of the result links on the page. Click enter to go to that result.
